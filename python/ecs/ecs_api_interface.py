    """This class facilitates the use of our REST API by allowing us to call API endpoints like functions.

    ----

    To easily use one of the API endpoints of api.ecs.rocks, simply pass the endpoint's path to this class's
    ctor. For example, if you wanted to use parsePhoneNumber, you could simply construct an instance of this
    class as follows:
        parse_phone_number = ecs.EcsApiInterface(method_path="/v0/util/parsePhoneNumber")

    And then you could call it like so:
        parse_phone_number({
            "event-subject": "test",
            "event-body": "example"
        })
